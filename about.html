        <h1>About this Website </h1>
        <br>
        <p> This website is my first one I have put together.  This Page was created to help inspire kids ages 8-12, learn and practice, or simply play their favorite sport. There is so much that little athletes can do to help bring the community together by playing sports. They can learn sportsmanship, develop team work, friendships and learn how to play the sport effectively and with dedication to have fun.  Players with parental permission will be involved with going to sporting events and learn how true athletes play their sport.  Then they will talk with their leaders and parents what they have  observed.<br></p>
     
        <!--permission granted fall 2018 via email-->
        <p>Playing Sports is better than sitting at a computer, playing video games or playing on their phone all day.  If they go out and play, they might learn a thing or two, then who knows! Maybe, the parents might just get involved with playing their child's new favorite sport.<br></p>   
        <p>Here is what one father named Mr. Johnson, had to say about it, <i><q>Baseball is one of my favorite sport because it helps kids to learn the sport and I played baseball when I was young. Even though I love to watch it, I helped my oldest learn to play through this program.  He learned how to stand and swing the bat and even how to catch and to throw the ball.</q></i><br> Another person named Mr. Hansen said, <b><q>Basketball is Awesome!</q></b>Then he followed to say, <i><q>Watching John Stockton with the Utah Jazz play basketball inspired me to be like him in my youth. Even though I never met him, idolizing his plays on tv. encouraged me to learn and practice basketball.  Since then I developed how to be a team player, build friendships, build communication with others and most importantly how to have fun.</q></i><br> Lastly, Mr. Turner said, <i><q>I learned how to shoot the basketball and how to focus on the hoop when I shoot, and I loved it when I help can help others do the same in basketball.  I even found a way to bond with my family through practicing with them.</q></i><br></p>     
        
        <!--found from brainquotes.com fall of 2018-->
        <blockquote>A quote I found from Brainyquotes.com says, <q>I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</q> -Michael Jordan.
