            <p>Just about everyone who wishes to join us to have fun in learning how to play these sports from ages 8-12. We will divide players into teams and gender according to number. If there is not enough in between, we can do Co-Ed also. Our promise
                is that we will not turn down anyone who comes to play.</p>
